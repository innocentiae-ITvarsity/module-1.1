         <h2>About us</h2>
<p>Rare secrets exist in the foothills of Africa. We have been on an exciting journey of discovery, seeking out and selecting the finest natural and powerful African oils and extracts honoured in ancient advice. Never tested on animals and free from ingredients perceived to be harsh on skin, our luxurious formulations will deliver superior skin benefits to care for skin. </p>
<p>On our journey we found the sacred Marula tree and used its oil for its hydrating and moisturising properties. We found the aromatic Rooibos bush and used its leaves for its powerful antioxidants. We found the majestic Baobab tree and used the oil from its seeds for its youthful properties. We found the Mongongo tree and used its oil for its hydrating and regenerating properties.  With these trusted and treasured ingredients, we created a range inspired by the earth and the wisdom passed down from generation to generation.
    We endeavour to stay respectful and responsible in honouring the treasures entrusted to us by Africa. Responsibly made to care for the community and our customers.</p>
